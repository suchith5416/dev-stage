    <p>In bachelorette and bachelor parties, brides and grooms traditionally gather separately—though joint parties are definitely common—with their favorite people to celebrate the last moments of singledom. What used to be one night of revelry has morphed into a multi-day destination affair that typically occurs six to eight weeks before the wedding, with groups jetting off to destinations such as Charleston, Texas, New York City, and Scottsdale.</p>
    <br>
<p>An engagement party is just that: a celebration of getting engaged. Though it typically occurs a few months after the proposal, it can also happen the night of. These “surprise” engagement parties, which are sometimes considered a separate event, are typically coordinated by a member of the couple popping the question and are more informal in nature. Immediate family members and close friends may travel to attend the smaller-scale celebration, but it is most often attended by friends or relatives that live close by to where the proposal happened, or who helped coordinate the proposal. </p>
